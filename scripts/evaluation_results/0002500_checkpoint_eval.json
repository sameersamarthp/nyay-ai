In general, a writ of habeas corpus can be filed when a person believes they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned.

This is based on the principle of double jeopardy, which is a fundamental right protected by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Fifth Amendment states that \"no person shall... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" (U.S. Const. amend. V)\n\nThe double jeopardy clause prohibits the government from prosecuting a person for the same offense more than once. This means that if a person is acquitted or convicted of an offense, they cannot be retried for the same offense. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the double jeopardy clause to prohibit retrials, and has held that the clause applies to both federal and state courts. (United States v. Miller, 471 F.2d 1133 (D.C. Cir. 1972)) In other words, once a person has been tried and convicted of an",
