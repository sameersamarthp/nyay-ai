## 🎯 Purpose & Overview

**The Problem**: General-purpose AI models like ChatGPT or Claude struggle with India-specific legal queries. They often:
- Cite incorrect jurisdictions (e.g., stating Magistrates can quash FIRs when only High Courts can)
- Lack depth on Indian statutes, case law, and procedures
- Cannot access real Indian court judgments
- Send your sensitive legal queries to third-party servers

**The Solution**: Nyay AI is a specialized legal assistant that:
- ✅ **Knows Indian Law**: Trained on 58,000+ real judgments from Delhi and Bombay High Courts
- ✅ **Runs Locally**: 100% privacy - your queries never leave your machine
- ✅ **Fast & Lightweight**: 2 GB model runs on M1/M2 Macs at 68 tokens/sec
- ✅ **Accurate**: Outperforms base Llama 3.2 3B on India-specific legal questions
- ✅ **Free & Open**: No API costs, no subscriptions, no data collection

**Use Cases**:
- Legal researchers exploring case law
- Law students learning Indian statutes
- Lawyers needing quick references
- Developers building legal tech products
- Anyone needing preliminary legal information about Indian law

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a research prototype. Always verify legal information with qualified professionals.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: As one can make out, 90% of the code was written by Claude Code, with me giving the directions.

## 🚀 Why Nyay AI is Different

### 1. 🔒 **Privacy First**

Unlike ChatGPT, Claude, or other cloud AI services:

| Feature | Cloud AI (ChatGPT/Claude) | Nyay AI |
|---------|---------------------------|---------|
| **Data Privacy** | ❌ Queries sent to third-party servers | ✅ 100% local - never leaves your machine |
| **Internet Required** | ❌ Yes | ✅ No - works offline |
| **Usage Logging** | ❌ May be logged for training | ✅ Zero logging |
| **Cost** | ❌ $20-30/month | ✅ Free |
| **Data Retention** | ❌ Unknown retention period | ✅ No data retention |

**Why it matters**: Legal queries often involve sensitive client information, pending cases, or confidential matters. With Nyay AI, your queries remain completely private.

### 2. ⚡ **Local Inference**

Nyay AI runs entirely on your machine using **Ollama**:
- **Zero latency from network calls** - responses in seconds, not minutes
- **No rate limits** - query as much as you want
- **Works offline** - no internet dependency
- **Optimized for Apple Silicon** - leverages M1/M2 GPU acceleration

**Performance on M2 MacBook Pro**:
- **Speed**: ~68 tokens/second
- **Memory**: ~3 GB RAM during inference
- **Model Size**: 2 GB on disk

### 3. 📦 **Quantization - Quality Meets Efficiency**

We use **Q4_K_M quantization** (4-bit) to compress the model from 6 GB to 2 GB:

| Quantization | Size | Quality | Speed | Best For |
|--------------|------|---------|-------|----------|
| F16 (Full) | 6 GB | 100% | Slow | Research |
| Q8_0 | 3.5 GB | 99%+ | Medium | High accuracy needs |
| **Q4_K_M** ✨ | **2 GB** | **97-98%** | **Fast** | **Production use** |
| Q4_0 | 1.8 GB | 95% | Fastest | Extreme constraints |

**Why Q4_K_M?**
- **97-98% quality retention** - minimal accuracy loss
- **68% size reduction** - fits easily on consumer hardware
- **3x faster inference** - compared to full-precision models
- **Balanced trade-off** - best quality-per-GB ratio

**Real-world impact**: You can run a high-quality legal AI on a MacBook Air without sacrificing accuracy.

### 4. 🎓 **Fine-Tuned on Real Data**

Unlike general models, Nyay AI was trained on:
- **58,222 real court judgments** from Delhi and Bombay High Courts
- **7,972 carefully curated training examples** across 4 task types:
  - Judgment summarization
  - Legal question answering
  - Outcome analysis
  - Information extraction

**Training method**: QLoRA 8-bit fine-tuning
- Trains only 0.3% of parameters (8M out of 3B)
- Achieves 97-99% of full fine-tuning quality
- Fits in 19 GB memory vs 28 GB for full fine-tuning

## 📊 Major Achievements

### Performance Comparison: Nyay AI vs Base Llama 3.2 3B

We evaluated both models on 20 India-specific legal queries across 8 categories. Here are the key results:

#### **Overall Evaluation Score**

| Model | Overall Score | Coherence | Legal Terminology | Accuracy |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Nyay AI** | **63.9/100** | **90%** | **75%** | **Good** |
| Base Llama 3.2 | ~45/100 | 70% | 45% | Fair |

**Nyay AI is 42% better overall** than the base model on Indian legal queries.

#### **Task-Specific Performance**

| Task Type | Nyay AI Score | Performance |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Statutory Interpretation** | **84.2/100** | ✅ Excellent |
| **Fundamental Rights** | **82.0/100** | ✅ Excellent |
| **Jurisdiction** | **76.3/100** | ✅ Good |
| **Procedural Law** | **72.7/100** | ✅ Good |
| **Legal Q&A** | **64.3/100** | ✅ Good |
| **Concept Explanation** | **63.6/100** | ✅ Good |
| **Legal Reasoning** | **61.3/100** | ✅ Good |

#### **Real Example: Critical Jurisdictional Error Caught**

**Query**: *"What are the grounds for quashing an FIR under Section 482 CrPC?"*

**Base Llama 3.2 3B Response**:
```
The Magistrate can quash an FIR under Section 482 if there is no
prima facie case or the complaint is frivolous...
```
❌ **WRONG** - Only the High Court has this power, not Magistrates!

**Nyay AI Response**:
```
Under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the High Court
has inherent powers to quash an FIR. The grounds include:
1. No prima facie case is made out
2. The allegations do not constitute an offense
3. The complaint is frivolous or vexatious
...
```
✅ **CORRECT** - Properly identifies High Court jurisdiction

This demonstrates how **Nyay AI's fine-tuning on real judgments prevents critical factual errors** that could mislead users.

## 🛠️ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: M1/M2 Mac with 16 GB+ RAM (recommended: 32 GB)
- **OS**: macOS 12+ (Monterey or later)
- **Software**: Python 3.11+, Git, [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)

### Option 1: Use the Pre-Deployed Model (Recommended)

If you have the pre-built GGUF model:

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama
# Download from: https://ollama.ai/download

# 2. Create model from Modelfile
ollama create nyay-ai -f models/nyay-ai-gguf/Modelfile

# 3. Use the model
ollama run nyay-ai "What is Section 498A IPC?"

# Interactive mode
ollama run nyay-ai

# API mode
ollama serve  # Start server at http://localhost:11434
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "nyay-ai",
  "prompt": "What is habeas corpus?",
  "stream": false
}'
```

### Option 2: Build from Source (Full Pipeline)

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyay-ai.git
cd nyay-ai

# 2. Setup data collection environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Download and process data (Phase 1)
# See docs/PHASE1_DATA_COLLECTION.md for detailed instructions
python scripts/load_aws_metadata.py --data-dir ./data/aws_data/data
python scripts/process_aws_pdfs.py --tar-dir ./data/aws_data/tar

# 4. Generate training data (Phase 2)
# Requires Anthropic API key for Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python scripts/prepare_training_data.py

# 5. Setup training environment
python3 -m venv .venv-train
source .venv-train/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-training.txt

# 6. Train model (Phase 3)

  --checkpoint models/nyay-ai-checkpoints-v4/0003000_adapters.safetensors

# 8. Setup llama.cpp for GGUF conversion
bash scripts/setup_llama_cpp.sh

# 9. Convert to GGUF format
bash scripts/convert_mlx_to_gguf.sh

# 10. Deploy with Ollama
ollama create nyay-ai -f models/nyay-ai-gguf/Modelfile
ollama run nyay-ai
```

### Option 3: Quick Test (Pre-trained Checkpoint)

If you have the checkpoint files but not the GGUF model:

```bash
# Setup training environment
source .venv-train/bin/activate

# Test with MLX directly
python scripts/evaluate_model.py \
  --checkpoint models/nyay-ai-checkpoints-v4/0003000_adapters.safetensors \
  --limit 5

# Convert to GGUF
bash scripts/convert_mlx_to_gguf.sh
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Interactive Chat

```bash
$ ollama run nyay-ai

>>> What is the difference between bail and anticipatory bail?

Bail and anticipatory bail are both legal remedies under the Code of
Criminal Procedure (CrPC), but they serve different purposes:

1. **Bail (Section 437/439 CrPC)**:
   - Granted AFTER arrest
   - Person is already in custody
   - Seeks temporary release pending trial
   ...

2. **Anticipatory Bail (Section 438 CrPC)**:
   - Granted BEFORE arrest
   - Pre-arrest protection
   - Seeks to avoid arrest in anticipation of accusation
   ...
```

### Python API

```python
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:11434/api/generate', json={
    'model': 'nyay-ai',
    'prompt': 'What is Public Interest Litigation (PIL)?',
    'stream': False
})

print(response.json()['response'])
```
